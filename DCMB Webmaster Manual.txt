Webmaster
=========
Welcome to your position as Webmaster! This manual will guide you as you perform your job. You are highly encouraged to edit it as much as possible so that it stays helpful and up-to-date. You should also communicate with the previous webmaster, in particular to get any passwords and/or permissions you need.

Job Description
---------------
The job of the webmaster, most generally, is to keep the band up-to-date on the internet. This can include keeping directorate descriptions current, signing the band up for the newest social network, or even completely redoing the band website when needed.
You also have to take care of some communication, both within the band and with alumni. Basically, whatever the Band does on the internet is your job.

DCMB on the Internet
====================

The Band Website
----------------
The Band Website is currently dcmb.dartmouth.edu. We also have www.dartmouth.edu/~dcmb, which currently simply redirects to the main one. It's your job to keep it up to date, and to put up things as requested by other Directorate members.

[*Space for Andrew to write about how the website runs, hosting, and whatever else is important to know about it*]

Google Account
--------------
The Band Google Account is Dartmouth.College.Marching.Band@gmail.com. Use it for whatever seems fit. Right now it is used for the calendar, which you should update whenever you hear about events, and an interest form. Make sure the publicity chairs have access to the interest form, and make any changes they request.
All emails to this account forward to the Band Account, so you don't have to worry too much about checking it.

Facebook Group
--------------
The Facebook group (http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=2200012421) is for members of the DCMB, past and present. It's a good way to get in touch with young alumni who the college has not yet pinned down, and thus cannot be reached so easily by Friends of the Band. If there are alumni events (homecoming, banquet, reunion, etc), you can use it to announce them.

Facebook Fan Page
-----------------
The Facebook fan page (http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Dartmouth-College-Marching-Band/171192469559145) is a place for everyone, not just bandies, to Like the Marching Band. You can use it to post happy little DCMB status messages for everyone to see. It's also good if there are some recent pictures up there.

There's another automatically created fan page: http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Dartmouth-College-Marching-Band/107729792581483
I've been trying to get control of it, but without any real luck. Maybe you'll have better luck.

Historian
=========
As webmaster you should receive a collection of photos, old shows, music, and other historical documents, from whoever has been photographing/recording the band. There should (perhaps) be a section on the website for displaying old pictures and shows. For now, the photo- and video-hosting are being managed via Facebook and Youtube, so maybe that's the best way to go. These responsibilities are eventually going to be passed onto the official 2013 Historian (and all Historians thereafter), but for now we Webmasters have to handle most of it.

Things to Do
============

At the Beginning of Winter
--------------------------
Everything needs to get updated based on elections. This means putting up Directorate pictures and descriptions on the website (send out lots of blitzes harassing the Directorate) and updating admins and officers on the Facebook group. Get the term calendar from Big 4 as early as possible and make sure it goes on the calendar. Also add other events like Band Camp, potluck, and scavenger hunt. Also change the email on the Join the Band page.

At the Beginning of Fall
------------------------
Once the band has new freshmen, make sure they all get Facebook invites. Once there's a secure section on the website, make sure everyone's properly signed up for it. Make sure that the main photos on the website are representative of the band as it is right now.

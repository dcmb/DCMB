    <h1>Directorate</h1>
    <p>The DCMB is directed by a group of elected students, with the
    help of our faculty advisor.</p>
    <p>[As you can see below, I had problems with alignment. For h3, I
    have clear:left, so that the text is only next to its own
    picture. However, this also pushed it below the menu bar. I could
    just put a bunch of breaks after each paragraph, but I feel like
    there must be a better way I don't know about? Also, I had hoped
    the top of the pictures would align with the top of the
    paragraphs, but they don't and I don't know what I need to adjust.]</p>
    
    <h3>Coke Machine</h3>
    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/coke.jpg" width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>The coke machine has headed the marching band since time
    immemorial. When conflicts arise, it has final, absolute,
    unquestionable say.</p>
    
    <h3>Faculty Advisor: <a href="mailto:Matthew.Marsit@dartmouth.edu">Matthew
    Marsit</a></h3>

    school and the athletics department, accompanies us to games, and
    generally assists the student directorate.</p>

    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/gov_hawaii.jpg"
    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>The role of the governor of Hawaii is not unlike that of the
    coke machine.</p>
    
    <h3>President: <a href="mailto:sunshine11@dartmouth.edu">Grace
    Nauman</a></h3>
    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/grace_nauman.jpg"

    band.</p>

    Nicolich-Henkin</a></h3>
    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/leah_nh.jpg"
    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>The general manager is in charge of scheduling games,
    away trips, banquets, and visiting bands.</p>
    <p>Leah was drawn to the band because she likes to hit things, espcially cymbals, and more recently drums.</p>

    <h3>Conductor/Drum Major: <a
    href="mailto:kfitz@dartmouth.edu">Katie Fitzgerald</a></h3>
    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/question.jpg"
    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>The conductor/drum major runs band rehearsals, leads the band
    in parade and onto the field, and conducts the band on the field
    and in the stands.</p>

    href="mailto:margaret.y.flanagan@dartmouth.edu">Maggie Flanagan</a></h3>
    <p class="floatLeft"><img src="images/directorate/question.jpg"
    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>The apprentice conductor/drum major assists the conductor/drum

    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p class="floatRight"><img src="images/directorate/question.jpg"
    width="108" height="108"/></p>
    <p>Each week the show chairs head the band meeting to write the
    script for the next week and then put all our ideas together
    into a funny show.</p>
    <p>At first glance, Kenny appears to be a normal person. Upon closer inspection, however, you will find that he cannot remember anything before three days ago and has a strange tattoo on his left shoulderblade that reads "Bubbles." For now, he reads marching band shows into a microphone at football games, until one day in three years, when he must travel to a small town in Nebraska to find the man who kidnapped his pet goldfish and started this whole mess... or so he believes...</p>

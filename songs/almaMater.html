    <h1>Dear Old Dartmouth (Alma Mater)</h1>
    <p>Dear old Dartmouth, give a rouse<br>
  For the College on the hill,<br>
  For the Lone Pine above her,<br>
  And the loyal ones who love her.<br>
  Give a rouse, give a rouse, with a will!<br>
  For the sons of old Dartmouth,<br>
  For the daughters of Dartmouth.<br>
  Though 'round the girdled Earth they roam,<br>
  Her spell on them remains.<br>
  They have the still North in their hearts,<br>
  The hill winds in their veins,<br>
  And the granite of New Hampshire<br>
  In their muscles and their brains.<br>
  And the granite of New Hampshire<br>
  In their muscles and their brains.<br>
  <br>
  Dear old Dartmouth, set a watch,<br>
  Lest the old traditions fail.<br>
  Stand as sister stands by brother.<br>
  Dare a deed for the old mother.<br>
  Greet the world from the hills with a hail!<br>
  For the sons of old Dartmouth,<br>
  For the daughters of Dartmouth.<br>
  Around the world they keep for her<br>
  Their old undying faith.<br>
  They have the still North in their soul,<br>
  The hill winds in their breath,<br>
  And the granite of New Hampshire<br>
  Is made part of them 'til death.<br>
  And the granite of New Hampshire<br>
  Is made part of them 'til death.</p>

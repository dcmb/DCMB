Winter 2010 Schedule
====================

<p class="floatright"><img src="images/schedulepic.jpg" width="288" height="144"></p>
In the fall, the band has practice every week on Thursday and
Friday from 4 to 6 PM. [Except that Thursday rehearsal keeps
getting moved around.] In the winter we have practices [whenever
it is we have practices]. Below is a schedule of the games at
which we will be playing.

All our practices are held in Hartman. Don't know where Hartman
is? In the Hop, go down the stairs past Spaulding, and then turn around and go
down some more stairs, and then turn right and go down some more
stairs. Walk straight ahead and it's on the right. It's on the
level below the jewelry studio and woodshop.

[Calender? Table with dates? I really don't know how this should
be arranged. Also, should we include social events like IM hockey
games? I think these should go on the members announcement page...]

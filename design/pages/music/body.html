<p>The DCMB plays a wide variety of music, ranging from the
occasional march to popular songs to movie and video game
music and more. Some of our favorites include "Hey Baby", "Build me
up Buttercup", "The Muppets Theme", "Pirates of the Caribbean",
and "Time Warp".</p>
<p>In addition to these, in our weekly parade, and while marching
on and off the field, and whenever the football team scores, we
play the school fight songs, aka "Dartmouth Tunes" (DT's).</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/songs/dt1">Dartmouth's in Town Again</a></li>
  <li><a href="/songs/dt2">Come Stand Up Men</a></li>
  <li><a href="/songs/dt3">As the Backs Go Tearing By</a></li>
  <li><a href="/songs/dt4">Glory to Dartmouth</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few more Dartmouth songs the band either plays or
sings: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/songs/alma-mater">Dear Old Dartmouth (Alma
Mater)</a></li>
<li><a href="/songs/son-of-a-gun">Son of a Gun for Beer</a></li>
<li><a href="/songs/pea-green">Pea Green Freshmen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>[There are recordings of the wind symphony playing these, and
there are not-as-nice recordings on the old band site, so these
pages should include those.]</p>

Directorate
===========

The DCMB is directed by a group of elected students, with the
help of our faculty advisor.

[As you can see below, I had problems with alignment. For h3, I
have clear:left, so that the text is only next to its own
picture. However, this also pushed it below the menu bar. I could
just put a bunch of breaks after each paragraph, but I feel like
there must be a better way I don't know about? Also, I had hoped
the top of the pictures would align with the top of the
paragraphs, but they don't and I don't know what I need to adjust.]

* ### Coke Machine

    The coke machine has headed the marching band since time

    Each week the show chairs head the band meeting to write the
    script for the next week and then put all our ideas together
    into a funny show.
    
    At first glance, Kenny appears to be a normal person. Upon closer inspection, however, you will find that he cannot remember anything before three days ago and has a strange tattoo on his left shoulderblade that reads "Bubbles." For now, he reads marching band shows into a microphone at football games, until one day in three years, when he must travel to a small town in Nebraska to find the man who kidnapped his pet goldfish and started this whole mess... or so he believes...

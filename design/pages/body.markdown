What is the DCMB?
=================

A Marching Band

The Dartmouth College Marching Band is an integral part of many
Dartmouth sporting events. In the fall, we open every home
football game with a parade through Hanover, concerts at alumni
events, a show on the field, the national anthem, and the alma
mater. During games we keep the crowd
lively by playing tunes in the stands, and go on the field again
at halftime. After the game, if Dartmouth wins, we celebrate by
marching through the library playing our school fight songs. In
the winter, we continue to play as the <a href="/pep-band">Pep
Band!</a>

A Scatter Band
--------------

The DCMB has been a scatter band (sometimes called "scramble
band") since the 1960's. Because we are a small school, we do not
have the numbers it would take to do formal marching formations,
like you might have done in high school. Instead, our shows are
based around a humorous script collectively written each week by
members of the band. We march out onto the field, but then we run
into a formation that serves as a compliment or punch line to the
jokes in the script. As a result we spent very little time on
marching drill, and have a funny show that generally pokes fun at
our opponents.

A Social Group
--------------
Band members do many things together in addition to playing and
marching. Our social chairs arrange events including a
potluck, a scavenger hunt, or anything else that seems
fun. In the winter the band plays intramural hockey
together. We're not great, but we have fun! Freshmen often make
some of their first and closest friends in the band.

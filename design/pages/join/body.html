<p>The DCMB welcomes new members from any grade and at any time of
the year, and there are no auditions. You can even borrow an instrument if you don't have one,
and we'll get you set up with a uniform and music as fast as
can. We'll have a number of events for freshmen during Dimensions
and Orientation. If you're already here, just come to one of our <a
href="schedule.html">rehearsals.</a> If you have more
questions, you can contact our publicity chairs, <a href="mailto:Tyler.L.Spunaugle@dartmouth.edu">Tyler Spunaugle</a> and <a
href="mailto:Margaret.Y.Flanagan@dartmouth.edu">Maggie Flanagan.</a> Either way, it's even easier
for us if you fill out the
following form to let us know you're interested.</p>
<p>[Matt mentioned "interest forms for potential freshman" but I'm
not really sure what to do with that.]</p>
